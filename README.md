# Experimental Branch for Project 3

# <b style="color: red"> Don't Merge with main branch</b>

For testing maps and charts with HTML, CSS, JS


### Ideas
- Map (leaflet)
    - Heatmap
    - Heatmap for each level (1, 2, 3)
    - Marker clusters plugin?
    - Different markers for major charging companies
    - Different markers for levels / future locations
    - By Status
- Charts (Plotly)
    - Filter By State?
    - By State per capita (need population data)
    - By top 20 metro areas
    - By Number of Points
    - Top Operators
    - Number of Level 1, 2, 3
    - Pie Chart (Public vs Private)
